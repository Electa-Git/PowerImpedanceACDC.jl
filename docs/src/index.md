## Overview

HVDCstability.jl is a Julia package, which focuses on the impedance-based stability. Simulator provides support for the power system construction using detailed components. Components and their interconnections are modeled as multiport networks using ABCD parameters.

Implemented components are:
- Impedances
- AC and DC grid equivalents (sources)
- Transformers
- Overhead lines
- Cables
- MMCs (using various controllers)

Developed by:
- Aleksandra Lekic, Jef Beerten - KU Leuven / EnergyVille
- with the help of: Philippe De Rua, Hakan Ergun, Thomas Roose, Ozgur Can Sakinci, Willem Leterme and Alejandro Bajo Salas - KU Leuven / EnergyVille
