    small_gain(G1, G2, omega, title::String = "Small gain: SVD")

Performs a small gain analysis by computing the maximum singular values of two system transfer function 
matrices `G1` and `G2` across a range of frequencies `omega` and visualizing their product.

## Parameters
- `G1::Array{Matrix{Complex}}`: A collection of system matrices evaluated at different frequencies (first system).
- `G2::Array{Matrix{Complex}}`: A collection of system matrices evaluated at different frequencies (second system).
- `omega::Vector{Real}`: A vector of angular frequencies (in rad/s) at which `G1` and `G2` are evaluated.
- `title::String`: (Optional) Title of the small gain plot. Default is `"Small gain: SVD"`.

## Returns
- `Vector{Float64}`: The maximum singular values of the product `G1(ω) * G2(ω)` at each frequency.

## Methodology
1. **Compute Singular Values**:
   - The singular values of `G1(ω)`, `G2(ω)`, and their product `G1(ω) * G2(ω)` are computed.
   - The maximum singular value at each frequency is extracted.

2. **Visualization**:
   - A logarithmic plot is generated for `σ_max(G1(ω) * G2(ω))` (black solid line).
   - Individual singular values for `G1(ω)` (blue dashed) and `G2(ω)` (red dashed) are also displayed.
   - The x-axis and y-axis are plotted on a logarithmic scale.

## Example Usage
```julia
# Define example data
omega = 2 * pi * logspace(-3, 6, 100)  # Frequency range in rad/s
G1 = [rand(ComplexF64, 2, 2) for _ in omega]  # Example transfer function matrices for G1
G2 = [rand(ComplexF64, 2, 2) for _ in omega]  # Example transfer function matrices for G2

# Small gain analysis
small_gain_index = small_gain(G1, G2, omega)

println("Small Gain Index:\n", small_gain_index)
```
