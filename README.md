# PowerImpedanceACDC
PowerImpedanceACDC is a Julia-based implementation for the frequency-domain analysis of modern power systems.
Its core functionalities include impedance/admittance characterization and small-signal stability assessment.
The analysis relies on analytical models validated against the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation software PSCAD.
The implemented components are:
- Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) with various controls (Grid-Following and Grid-Forming)
- Two-level converter with various controls
- Overhead lines and underground cables
- Synchronous generator
- Transformers
- Impedances
- Ideal voltage sources

Following features are currently implemented:
- Impedance/admittance identification
- Stability assessment via the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), applicable to standalone-stable Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems
- Oscillation mode identification via Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) and bus participation factors
- Passivity assessment and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) functions 

The following figure shows the admittances of an High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) link with two MMCs, validated against PSCAD. You can find this example, along with explanations, in the `example` folder.
